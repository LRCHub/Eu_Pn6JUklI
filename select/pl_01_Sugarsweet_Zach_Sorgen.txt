Ooh that sugar sweet
You got what I need
Slppin' on the potion
All that good emotion
Just my kinda heat
Keep it on repeat
Testify the motion
Lovin' this devotion
Live it up. live it up,
live it up sweet emotion
'Cause every time, every night,
you and I on a roll
Switch it up, switch it up,
switch it up where I'm going
Stay on the fly, just in lime,
know the right way to go
I'm on the road it's my time
Taking control of my life
I want to run the red lights
I've got to run this show
You always take me so high
You always make the highlights
I love the way we vibe vibe
You're like a centerfold
Ooh that sugar sweet
You got what I need
Slppin' on the potion
All that good emotion
Just my kinda heat
Keep it on repeat
Testify the motion
Lovin' this devotion
Ooh that sugar
All I want, all I want,
all I want is satisfaction
Make a move baby you got
nothing to lose
Give me that, give me that,
give me that good reaction
Gonna make it right a little
like an offer I can't refuse
I'm on the road it's my time
Taking control of my life
I want to run the red lights
I've got to run this show
You always take me so high
You always make the highlights
I love the way we vibe vibe
You're like a centerfold
Ooh that sugar sweet
You got what I need
Slppin' on the potion
All that good emotion
Just my kinda heat
Keep it on repeat
Testify the motion
Lovin' this devotion
Ooh that sugar
Sweet
Sweet

Ooh that sugar sweet
You got what I need
Slppin' on the potion
All that good emotion
Just my kinda heat
Keep it on repeat
Testify the motion
Lovin' this devotion
Oohs that sugar
